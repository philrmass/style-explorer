# Project Name: Style Explorer

### Author: Phil Mass

##Project Purpose:
This application will allow users to explore the colors in an image or on a website, and the relationship between those colors. It will do this by presenting the colors in a variety of two-dimensional and three-dimensional graphs. Users will also be able to select any color from the graph, adjust it in a hue-saturation-value touch-enabled color picker, and then easily copy that color's hex or rgba value to use in a website.

##Minimum Features For MVP:
* An image file loader to load images from local files or URLs
* A two-dimensional block graph showing the colors grouped and sorted along two color dimensions
* A HSV color picker with 3 directions of adjustment and easy color value copying

##Minimum Tools Used:
* React
* Redux
* Webpack
* Babel
* CSS Modules
* ESLint

##Additional Features After MVP:
* a three-dimensional graph of all colors in an HSV cylinder
* Loading and rendering of websites by URL using an embedded iframe
* A list of recent images or websites for quick reference
* Testing of all color logic functions
* Suggestions for colors that are aesthetically compatible
* A summary of the fonts and colors most used on the web
* Font comparison by rending a letter from all font's on top of each other
* Creation of an ortho-normal basis set for fonts, to be able to classify and identify them

##Additional Tools Used:
* WebGL
* Jest
* Web crawler (written or from a library)
